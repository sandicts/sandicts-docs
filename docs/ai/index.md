# Sandicts Shared AI Context Index

Use this file as the shared documentation router. Read the smallest useful set
of files for the current task.

## Reading Rules

- Start here, then open only docs whose `read-when` entries match the task.
- Prefer concise source-of-truth docs before long working drafts.
- Treat `docs/product/sandicts-mvp-functional-spec.md` as on-demand detail, not
  default context.
- Keep backend implementation patterns in the backend repo.
- Keep frontend implementation, screen, and component rules in the frontend repo.
- Do not duplicate product rules in app repositories; link back here.
