# Sandicts Pull Request Standard

## Purpose

Keep pull request titles and descriptions consistent across
`sandicts/nodejs-sandicts-api`, `sandicts/reactjs-sandicts-web`, and
`sandicts/sandicts-docs`.

Repository-specific differences belong in validation details and notes, not in
a different PR body shape.

## Title

For work with a Jira task, use:

```text
[KAN-123] <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

For documentation-only work without a Jira task, use:

```text
[NO-JIRA] docs(<scope>): <short summary>
```

Examples:

```text
[NO-JIRA] docs(product): define academy plan rules
[NO-JIRA] docs(process): define documentation granularity
```

Tracking rules:

- when a Jira task exists, its primary key must be the first characters in the
  PR title
- `[NO-JIRA]` is allowed only in `sandicts/sandicts-docs`, when no Jira task
  exists and every changed file is documentation or documentation-routing
  metadata
- `[NO-JIRA]` must not be used to bypass Jira for source code, runtime
  configuration, database schema, infrastructure, or product implementation
- new shared product and business rules without Jira should normally be
  delivered in `sandicts/sandicts-docs`
- documentation PRs in frontend or backend repositories continue to require a
  Jira key
- if a Jira task is created or discovered before merge, rename the PR to start
  with that Jira key and update the PR body
- never use `[NO-JIRA]` when any delivered work already belongs to a Jira task
- never use `[codex]`, only a branch name, or a title without either a Jira key
  or the approved `[NO-JIRA]` prefix
- if multiple Jira tasks are delivered, put the primary Jira key in the title
  and list related keys under `Notes`
- override any generic publishing helper, GitHub UI default, or branch-derived
  suggestion before creating or updating the PR
- do not rely on `gh pr create --fill` or a connector's optional title field to
  infer the Sandicts title

## Body

Every Sandicts repository must use this section order:

```md
## Summary

Describe clearly what this pull request changes and the intended scope.

## Problem

Explain the issue, need, or workflow gap this pull request addresses.

## Root cause

Explain the cause identified in code, flow, documentation, or configuration.
For docs-only or setup work, describe why the repository needed this change.

## Changes

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

## Files added or updated

- `path/to/file`
- `path/to/file`

## Impact

### Fixed

- item
- item

### Not changed

- item
- item

## Validation

- [ ] branch governance (CI: Governance)
- [ ] lint (CI: Quality)
- [ ] typecheck (CI: Quality)
- [ ] tests (CI: Test)
- [ ] build (CI: Build)
- [ ] dependency audit (CI: Dependency audit)
- [ ] manual validation completed

## Notes

- Primary Jira: `KAN-123`
- Related Jira: none
- Jira status: move delivered issue(s) to `In Review` after opening this PR
- Tracking exception: none
- Branch cleanup: delete branch after merge enabled
- Known gaps or skipped validation: none
```

For a `[NO-JIRA]` documentation PR, use these Notes values:

```md
- Primary Jira: not applicable (`NO-JIRA` documentation-only change)
- Related Jira: none
- Jira status: not applicable
- Tracking exception: no Jira task exists; PR contains documentation only
```

Rules:

- fill every section with current PR evidence before opening or updating the PR
- do not create or leave a PR with a blank body, omitted body, raw template
  placeholders, or a shortened alternative such as `What changed` / `Why`
- preserve the headings and order from the local `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- keep skipped validation and repo-specific rationale under `Validation` or
  `Notes`
- explain the tracking exception under `Notes` for every `[NO-JIRA]` PR
- for docs-only changes, mention `git diff --check` under
  `Known gaps or skipped validation` instead of adding a custom checkbox
- update the PR body if the scope changes after opening the PR

## Repository Validation

For `sandicts/nodejs-sandicts-api`:

- docs-only: run `git diff --check`
- backend app, API, auth, persistence, config, or startup-sensitive changes:
  run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:ci`, `npm run lint:ci`, and
  `npm run build`
- public API, Swagger/OpenAPI, auth/session, or startup-sensitive changes: add
  a smoke check when practical
- dependency or security changes: run the repository dependency audit command
  or document why it was not applicable

For `sandicts/reactjs-sandicts-web`:

- docs-only: run `git diff --check`
- frontend app, configuration, or setup changes: run `npm run lint`,
  `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run build`
- dependency or security changes: run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- tests: run when test tooling exists and the change touches covered behavior

For dependency audit remediation in either application repository, also follow
`docs/ai/dependency-security-remediation.md`. Use a dedicated Jira task and PR,
keep the audit blocking at `moderate`, validate from `npm ci`, and update any
unrelated blocked PR only after the remediation reaches its integration branch.

For `sandicts/sandicts-docs`:

- run `git diff --check`
- inspect changed Markdown frontmatter, links, source-of-truth routing, and
  skill metadata when applicable
- do not mark lint, typecheck, tests, build, or dependency audit complete unless
  those commands exist in this repository and actually ran

Do not mark a validation checkbox complete unless that command, manual review,
or CI check actually ran and passed.
